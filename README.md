- 👋 Hi, I’m @NathanDansie

- 👀 I’m an electrical engineer that studied physics in school, but I'm interested in the nature of reality, physics and astronomy, making music, reading good books, and playing video games. 
  Part of my goal here is to learn how to build a VR teaching/learning experience, but I still feel I have a pretty limited programming skillset.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, but I also have some experience working with C++ and Arduino as hobbies and what I do for work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making omnichromatic images such as can be found on allrgb.com, which I've made some contributions on.
- 📫 I can be reached @gmail.com or on facebook perhaps, cause there aren't too many people with this name.
